		<p>Once upon a time there was a tomato family . One day the mom wanted to take a walk but the dad had to work so her next option was the baby . She and the baby were having fun they stoped for food and a nice slushy . When they stoped to a hill (looked like a mountin) . The only way to get back home was to clim up the hill so they climed the hill , the baby was far behind trying to clim the hill that is when the mom said hurry up . The baby tried but could not so the mom ran over and said ketchup . As she said that she smashed the baby with her bare hands then she thought of getting french fries .
